# TinySH
### TinySH is a tiny, basic shell written in Go. 
### It is still a very early work in progress and is not ready for daily use.
The main goal of this project is to see how small a shell with comfort features can reasonably be.
I am perfectly aware Go is the wrong tool for small binaries, and welcome the challenge.
